### Welcome! 👋

I'm Kristina, an aspiring software engineer based in the United States.

I build software to make others' lives easier, or at least, software useful to myself. 

My main tech stack is Django/Javascript/HTML.

Currently working on:
- [Campus Navigator App](https://github.com/mjc4785/Software-Engineering)
- Financial Data Pipeline for a medical clinic
